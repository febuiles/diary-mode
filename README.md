# diary-mode.el

A simple emacs mode for tracking your daily progress

## Usage

`M-x diary`: Get a nicely formatted list of what you achieved in the last 7 days.
`M-x diary-new-entry`: Write a new entry for today. Will append to existing entry if multiple calls happen on the same day.
`M-x diary-remove`: Remove a specific entry from the history.

## WIP

This is README-drive development, code will be public some day :)
